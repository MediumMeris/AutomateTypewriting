# AutomateTypewriting

First of all this is going to be a very short blog and is made purely for fun, but I hope it will be interesting to see the speed of Playwright in this example with a very simple implementation.
This is only for the purpose of testing the powerful side of Playwrights automation. It provides us with a lot of visible displays of how good the automation is. In this blog post I will show you how I automated the typing speed test to get the highest possible score in an interesting way.
